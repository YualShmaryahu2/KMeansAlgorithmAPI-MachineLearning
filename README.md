# KMeansAlgorithmAPI-MachineLearning
The K-means++ algorithm is used to choose initial centroids for the K-means algorithm. In this repository this algorithm will be implemented in Python and integrated with the K-means algorithm of KMeansAlgorithm-MachineLearning that will be ported to a C extension using the C API.
